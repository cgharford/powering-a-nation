                    Nearly 50 percent of U.S. electricity comes from coal. Coal&#45;fired power plants burn coal to generate steam,
                    which is used to turn the turbines of an electrical generator. <br> <br> 
                    The U.S. has one of the largest coal reserves in the world and burns it at about 600 plants across the nation. Generating
                    electricity from coal is common in the South and in the heartland, but less often used in regions such as the West Coast,
                    where hydroelectricity and natural gas are bigger sources of power. <br> <br>

                    Coal has been a dominant industry for most of the region&#39;s history. The county&#39;s newest mine began producing coal last February. <br> <br>

                   It can be hard to prove that any one of the chemicals caused health problems of a particular individual. 
                <q>We&#39;re exposed to a soup of chemicals,</q> said Kevin Crist, director of the Center for Air Quality at Ohio
                University. Crist said health problems can be influenced by interactions between chemicals, as well as by lifestyle factors.  <br> <br> 
                In addition, low income &#45; a common characteristic in Meigs County &#45; is correlated with health problems. One reason is that
                poor people are more likely to smoke than their wealthier counterparts. More than 30 percent of adult residents of Southeast
                Ohio smoke, compared to only about 25 percent of residents of other Ohio counties. <br> <br> 
                Crist said tall smokestacks on the existing plants probably disperse most pollutants away from Meigs County. But he said it
                is impossible to know for sure what residents are being exposed to, because no agency monitors the county&#39;s air. <br> <br>

                  Blue-collar labor is especially important in Meigs County, where fewer than 5 percent of adult residents hold college
                degrees and more than 25 percent have no high school diploma, according to the Ohio Office of Policy, Research
                and Strategic Planning. In 2007, Meigs County's median income was $27,287, about half the national average. <br> <br> 
                Many Meigs County residents support the new plant for the jobs it may bring to the community. Construction worker Greg
